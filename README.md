# Starbucks

Hello! I am creating the Starbucks website (only one page) from basic html and css and bit of javascript.

for the html page the reason why it's only in one page (yikes) was b/c I was working on it during my work and I was using another text editor and i emailed
it to myself lol. 

I am a super noob to this and I knoow there is a lot to work on but for now I am proud of this (despite how messy it looks) :)
